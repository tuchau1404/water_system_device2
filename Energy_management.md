## 3. Energy Consumption Analysis

### 3.1 ESP32-C3

**Active energy consumption:**

```
E_ESP32 = 0.2 A × 3.3 V × (48 mins / 60 mins) = 0.528 Wh/day
```

### 3.2 Simcom A7680 Module

**Transmit energy consumption:**

```
E_SIM = 0.1 A × 4 V × (48 mins / 60 mins) = 0.32 Wh/day
```

### 3.3 Sensor

**Sensor energy consumption:**

```
E_Sensor = 2 W × (48 mins / 60 mins) = 1.6 Wh/day
```

### 3.4 Total Energy Consumption

```
E_Total = 0.528 + 0.32 + 1.6 = 2.448 Wh/day
```

---

## 4. Energy Generation and Storage

### 4.1 Solar Panel Output

**Daily energy generation:**

```
E_Solar = 15 W × 6 hours/day = 90 Wh/day
```

### 4.2 Battery Storage

**Energy capacity:**

```
E_Battery = 3.7 V × 3.5 Ah × 2 = 25.9 Wh
```

---

## 5. Feasibility Analysis
